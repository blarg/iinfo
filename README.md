# iinfo
Info installation manager

A collection of tools and scripts for managing
info and man software documentation on a
machine.

A few exist,
but none of them really work in the way I'd
want them to.

* `iiconfig.sh` : package configuration
* `infogen.sh` : info generator
* `mangen.sh` : manual page generator

Source doc can be found [here](doc/index.html).
